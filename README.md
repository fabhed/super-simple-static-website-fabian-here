I will create a simple static website using Python and Flask. The website will display "Fabian was here" on the homepage and listen on port 80.

First, let's create the necessary files and folders for the project:

1. main.py: This is the entry point of the application.
2. templates: This folder will contain the HTML templates.
3. templates/index.html: This is the HTML template for the homepage.
4. requirements.txt: This file will contain the required dependencies.

Now, let's write the code for each file:

main.py
